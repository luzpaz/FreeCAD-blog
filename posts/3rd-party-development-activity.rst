This Blog also will feature occasional posts of non-core team developer activity for the rest of the community to be aware about. The beauty of FreeCAD is it's active community along with it's quick way to hack extensions (aka add-ons).

* `LibreCAD to FreeCAD import tool <https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=30951>`_ - An independent developer (Marc Berlioux) has created an initial version of CLI python script tool (`repo <https://framagit.org/MarcusFecit/LibreCadToFreeCad>`_) that imports LibreCAD DXF files in to FreeCAD sketches. It utilizes the `ezdxf` library. Unlike FreeCAD's embedded importing tool, the process creates a sketch for each layer present in the DXF and attempts to create basic constraints between the entities in order to directly obtain closed shapes. Read more about this useful tool's capabilities and usage in it's `GitLab README.md <https://framagit.org/MarcusFecit/LibreCadToFreeCad/blob/master/README.md>`_
